django-project-template
=======================

The standard Django project model has several flaws. It does not promote
writing standalone Django applications that live on the ``$PYTHONPATH``.

The ``create_django_project.py`` script creates an alternate Django
project structure with templates and functional default applications.
The main goal is to create a directory structure that emphasizes the
importance of the ``$PYTHONPATH`` and that makes it simple to create
easily deployable web sites.
